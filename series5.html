  <li><p class="five">Apple watches <i>Series 5</i> has been considered as the best smartwatch in the world. They took all the good features from Series 3 and 4, then formed them into 
    one sensational masterpiece. They added a couple more features but still made it with an aluminum body. It offers the sizes 40mm and 44mm and gold, silver, and space 
    grey colors. Depending on the size, which kind and color will determine how much the product costs. There are more options with the <i>Series 5</i>, for an additional 
    cost, you can get a stainless steel finish with the available colors of gold, space black, and silver. New to the <i>Series 5</i> is a titanium option, which comes in 
    space black. Lastly, there is a ceramic option that comes in pure white and also costs even more. The straps are changeable, and Apple made a collaboration with both 
    Nike and Hermes for special edition sports and leather straps. The biggest design improvement is the introduction of the titanium option, which is lighter but more
    durable. It comes with a refined navigation performance thanks to a built-in compass.</li>

     The recently developed feature is the always-on-display, which is a response to previous user complaints of having to move one's wrist to wake up the display. Although 
     in doing this, some argue that the always-on feature is a pain at night when you are trying to sleep because it is reactive meaning it gets brighter when it's needed, 
     and dims when it isn't. Since Series 4 was alreadt a fast performer, any speed differences may be hard to spot. However, you still get everything you've come to know 
     with an Apple Watch - sleep tracking, breathing monitor, heart rate monitoring, GPS, and many more. The watch will usually last for about 18 hours a day and then in 
     the evening you'll need to put it on charge. With the new software update it has added few more features. The health and fitness tracking has enhanced, women can now 
     monitor and track menstrual cycles accurately and there are added activity tracking options. There are also new noise level alerts that tell you if your surroundings 
     are too loud and may damage your hearing.
