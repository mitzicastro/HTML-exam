  <ul class="h3">
  <li><p class="three">After Series 1 and 2 were released, the following year <i>Series 3</i> was launched. In this edition, the big difference was the addition of a cellular feature, allowing 
    the watch to connect to mobile internet and get rid of the requirement for pairing with an iPhone. This definitely provided a brand new sense of connectivity. One of the best features of 
    the <i>Series 3</i> is its revamped Siri, which has its own watch face showing the users information they need most during the day. Due to the S3 CPU, which is a lot faster than its predecessor, 
    the S2, The digital assistant not only responds via text, but Siri can use audio directly on your watch too, and this increases its usefulness. The benefits include; being able to text messages, 
    call, leave a voicemail, set reminders or alerts, use map features, and stream music. </p></li>
    <li><p class="three">
    In 2018 <i>Series 4</i> was released. It featured some major improvements compared to Series 3, including larger displays, and it had either 40mm or 44mm sizing rather than the standard 38mm and 
    42mm. Apple made the speaker 50% louder for this version, and the microphone was relocated to the opposite side of the watch from the speaker to improve its calling functionality. The voices can 
    now be heard clearly, even in noisy surroundings.  Another big improvement was the addition of an electrical heart sensor, also known as "ECG/EKG". This allows the users to know their heart rate 
    at any time. It has the ability to detect an unusual heart rate that will notify you, even if you do not feel any symptoms. This feature could potentially save lives.
