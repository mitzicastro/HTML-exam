  <li><p class="six">When The Apple Watch <i>Series 6</i> was released, it wasn't alone. Apple watches SE also burst onto the scene alongside it. Apple hasn't done much improvement or upgrades 
    of this latest release. If you compare it to an apple watch series 4 or 5, there are multiple similarities. The Series 6 offers are new color options. There is a new 
    aluminum case in blue and, you can choose between the stainless steel model in steel or gold. There is also a really sleep black graphite option and a brand new color, 
    the red version. The always-on display feature remains. Then Apple made some improvements of making it brighter by 2.5 than the predecessor. This enables the users to 
    see the display in various lighting conditions. Apple has also announced a range of new bands with many colors and styles to choose from, such as the Solo loop and a 
    Braided Solo Loop. Neither has a clasp, which means you need to stretch the band over your wrist to put it on. One of the features that Apple was excited to talk about 
    would be the new fitness features. There's an additional health sensor on the belly of the watch that will monitor blood oxygen levels, and it does this through an app 
    called " Blood oxygen" and only takes 15 seconds to take a reading. It also collects data as you sleep or during the day as you go about your life. The gathered information 
    will be the basis for identifying any potential health issues you might have. All the other features remain the same, which you've probably become familiar with already 
    other than that. Thanks to the new S6 processor, the <i>series 6</i> is 20% faster than the series 5. It has raised the battery life to 18 hours to match the series 5 bus the 6 
    charges faster. You can get a full charge in 90 minutes.</p></li></ul>
