  <li><p class="two">Since the overly expensive edition had been low on sales, Apple had decided to drop the product but still kept the "sport version" that has been modified 
    and renamed, which is now known as <i>"Series 1"</i>. Apple had also decided to reduce their price a bit in order to make it affordable for most people. It still had 
    the aluminum build, and the features remain like the original, such as the side button, digital touch, force touch, multi-touch, and digital crown. The Apple <i>series 1</i> 
    wasn't really designed to be a fitness tracker, so its capabilities in this field are limited. The fitness app will monitor your fitness level to a certain extent, monthly 
    challenges were included in its activity app, as well as a high-intensity interval training workout mode. Nevertheless, in terms of fitness, the focus primarily lies on running.

  <li><p class="two">
    In the same year, Apple released <i>"Series 2"</i> into the market. While retaining the same sophisticated style and build of aluminum, it now also includes ceramic and stainless 
    steel versions. The <i>series 2</i> has been improved by including added waterproofing, a faster processor, and a swimming tracker but the main difference between both series was 
    that unlike <i>Series 1</i>,  <i>the Series 2</i> had a built-in GPS, which gave the ability to pair the watch with an iPhone without the use of the internet. This has been very 
    helpful since losing watches were a thing in the past. One further interesting feature is "Breathe" which alerts you occasionally to take a few deep breaths to combat stress. While 
    this might seem like a simple idea, it's surprisingly effective.
