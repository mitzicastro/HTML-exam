  <ul class="h3">
  <li><p class="one">The very first launched <i>apple watch</i> consists of three versions. The first is referred to as the "everyman edition" that is made of stainless steel. 
    The second was the "sport version" which is that of aluminum and was made to appeal to a more athletic audience. It also has a wristband equipped to working out that is made 
    out of nylon, has extra protection, and comes with several unique colors that you could choose from. The last version was made of no less than 18 karat gold. Any of these 
    versions did not include any sort of fitness program it only had the ability to track heart rate. All three versions came in the sizes of both 38mm and 42mm. 
    In addition, all of them had Bluetooth, wifi capabilities, and the ability to connect with the iPhone. Although in order to do so, it would require internet access. It provides 
    a digital crown, digital touch, force touch, multi-touch, and a side button. It also has the ability to sense your heart rate in a manner of minutes, which is helpful, especially 
    to individuals who have a heart problem. Since it was considered as a high-end fashion accessory, the price was a bit expensive, which most people could not afford. It was in the 
    market for about $17,000, which resulted in a low sale. Not only was it expensive, but it was also so heavy that it felt like a brick for one thing. As a matter of fact, it was 
    never mentioned again.</li>
