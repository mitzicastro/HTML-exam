      Site:knowyourmobile.com </a> </h6> <p>The very first launched <i>apple watch</i> consists of three versions. The
      first is referred to as the "everyman edition", which is made of stainless steel.
      Second, was the "sport version" which is made of aluminum and was made to appeal the more athletic audience. It
      also has a wristband equipped to working out
      that is made out of nylon, has extra protection, and comes with several unique colors that you could chose from.
      The last version was made of no less than 18
      karat gold. All three versions came in the sizes of both 38mm and 42mm. In addition, all of them had Bluetooth,
      wifi capabilities, and the ability to connect
      with the iPhone. Although in order to do so, it would require internet access. It provides a digital crown,
      digital touch, force touch, multi-touch, and a side
      button. It also has the ability to sense your heart rate in a manner of minutes. Since it was considered as a
      high-end fashion accessory, the price was a bit
      expensive. It was in the market for about $17,000 which resulted in a low sale. As a matter of fact, it was never
      mentioned again.

      <h3>Series 1 and 2</h3>

      <p>Since the overly expensive edition had been low on sales Apple had decided to drop the product but still kept
        the "sport version" that has been modified and
        renamed, which is now known as "Series 1". Apple had also decided to reduce their price a bit in order to make
        it affordable for most people. It still had the
        aluminum build and the features remain like the original such as the side button, digital touch, force touch,
        multi-touch, and digital crown. In the same year,
        Apple released "Series 2" into the market. The product still had the same aluminum build, but the main
        difference between both series was that unlike Series 1,
        the Series 2 had a built-in GPS which gave the ability to pair the watch with an iPhone without the use of the
        internet. This has been very helpful since losing
        watches were a thing in the past. </p>

      <h3>Series 3 and 4</h3>

      </p>
      <p>After Series 1 and 2 were released, the following year Series 3 was launched. In this edition, the big
        difference was the addition of a cellular feature, allowing
        the watch to connect to mobile internet and get rid of the requirement for pairing with an iPhone. This
        definitely provided a brand new sense of connectivity. The
        benefits include; being able to text messages, call, leave a voicemail, set reminders or alerts, use map
        features, and stream music.
