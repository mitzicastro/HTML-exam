  <li><p class="one">The very first launched <i>apple watch</i> consists of three versions. The first is referred to as the "everyman edition" that is made of stainless steel. 
    The second was the "sport version" which is that of aluminum and was made to appeal to a more athletic audience. It also has a wristband equipped to working out that is made 
    out of nylon, has extra protection, and comes with several unique colors that you could choose from. The last version was made of no less than 18 karat gold. Any of these 
    versions did not include any sort of fitness program it only had the ability to track heart rate. All three versions came in the sizes of both 38mm and 42mm. 
    In addition, all of them had Bluetooth, wifi capabilities, and the ability to connect with the iPhone. Although in order to do so, it would require internet access. It provides 
    a digital crown, digital touch, force touch, multi-touch, and a side button. It also has the ability to sense your heart rate in a manner of minutes, which is helpful, especially 
    to individuals who have a heart problem. Since it was considered as a high-end fashion accessory, the price was a bit expensive, which most people could not afford. It was in the 
    market for about $17,000, which resulted in a low sale. Not only was it expensive, but it was also so heavy that it felt like a brick for one thing. As a matter of fact, it was 
    never mentioned again.</li>

  <li><p class="two">Since the overly expensive edition had been low on sales, Apple had decided to drop the product but still kept the "sport version" that has been modified 
    and renamed, which is now known as <i>"Series 1"</i>. Apple had also decided to reduce their price a bit in order to make it affordable for most people. It still had 
    the aluminum build, and the features remain like the original, such as the side button, digital touch, force touch, multi-touch, and digital crown. The Apple <i>series 1</i> 
    wasn't really designed to be a fitness tracker, so its capabilities in this field are limited. The fitness app will monitor your fitness level to a certain extent, monthly 
    challenges were included in its activity app, as well as a high-intensity interval training workout mode. Nevertheless, in terms of fitness, the focus primarily lies on running.
  </li></p>
  <li><p class="two">
    In the same year, Apple released <i>"Series 2"</i> into the market. While retaining the same sophisticated style and build of aluminum, it now also includes ceramic and stainless 
    steel versions. The <i>series 2</i> has been improved by including added waterproofing, a faster processor, and a swimming tracker but the main difference between both series was 
    that unlike <i>Series 1</i>,  <i>the Series 2</i> had a built-in GPS, which gave the ability to pair the watch with an iPhone without the use of the internet. This has been very 
    helpful since losing watches were a thing in the past. One further interesting feature is "Breathe" which alerts you occasionally to take a few deep breaths to combat stress. While 
    this might seem like a simple idea, it's surprisingly effective.

  <ul class="h3">
  <li><p class="three">After Series 1 and 2 were released, the following year <i>Series 3</i> was launched. In this edition, the big difference was the addition of a cellular feature, allowing 
    the watch to connect to mobile internet and get rid of the requirement for pairing with an iPhone. This definitely provided a brand new sense of connectivity. One of the best features of 
    the <i>Series 3</i> is its revamped Siri, which has its own watch face showing the users information they need most during the day. Due to the S3 CPU, which is a lot faster than its predecessor, 
    the S2, The digital assistant not only responds via text, but Siri can use audio directly on your watch too, and this increases its usefulness. The benefits include; being able to text messages, 
    call, leave a voicemail, set reminders or alerts, use map features, and stream music. </p></li>
    <li><p class="three">
    In 2018 <i>Series 4</i> was released. It featured some major improvements compared to Series 3, including larger displays, and it had either 40mm or 44mm sizing rather than the standard 38mm and 
    42mm. Apple made the speaker 50% louder for this version, and the microphone was relocated to the opposite side of the watch from the speaker to improve its calling functionality. The voices can 
    now be heard clearly, even in noisy surroundings.  Another big improvement was the addition of an electrical heart sensor, also known as "ECG/EKG". This allows the users to know their heart rate 
    at any time. It has the ability to detect an unusual heart rate that will notify you, even if you do not feel any symptoms. This feature could potentially save lives.

  <ul class="h3">
  <li><p class="five">Apple watches <i>Series 5</i> has been considered as the best smartwatch in the world. They took all the good features from Series 3 and 4, then formed them into 
    one sensational masterpiece. They added a couple more features but still made it with an aluminum body. It offers the sizes 40mm and 44mm and gold, silver, and space 
    grey colors. Depending on the size, which kind and color will determine how much the product costs. There are more options with the <i>Series 5</i>, for an additional 
    cost, you can get a stainless steel finish with the available colors of gold, space black, and silver. New to the <i>Series 5</i> is a titanium option, which comes in 
    space black. Lastly, there is a ceramic option that comes in pure white and also costs even more. The straps are changeable, and Apple made a collaboration with both 
    Nike and Hermes for special edition sports and leather straps. The biggest design improvement is the introduction of the titanium option, which is lighter but more
    durable. It comes with a refined navigation performance thanks to a built-in compass.</li>   
  <li><p class="five">
     The recently developed feature is the always-on-display, which is a response to previous user complaints of having to move one's wrist to wake up the display. Although 
     in doing this, some argue that the always-on feature is a pain at night when you are trying to sleep because it is reactive meaning it gets brighter when it's needed, 
     and dims when it isn't. Since Series 4 was alreadt a fast performer, any speed differences may be hard to spot. However, you still get everything you've come to know 
     with an Apple Watch - sleep tracking, breathing monitor, heart rate monitoring, GPS, and many more. The watch will usually last for about 18 hours a day and then in 
     the evening you'll need to put it on charge. With the new software update it has added few more features. The health and fitness tracking has enhanced, women can now 
     monitor and track menstrual cycles accurately and there are added activity tracking options. There are also new noise level alerts that tell you if your surroundings 
     are too loud and may damage your hearing.

  <ul class="h3">
  <li><p class="six">When The Apple Watch <i>Series 6</i> was released, it wasn't alone. Apple watches SE also burst onto the scene alongside it. Apple hasn't done much improvement or upgrades 
    of this latest release. If you compare it to an apple watch series 4 or 5, there are multiple similarities. The Series 6 offers are new color options. There is a new 
    aluminum case in blue and, you can choose between the stainless steel model in steel or gold. There is also a really sleep black graphite option and a brand new color, 
    the red version. The always-on display feature remains. Then Apple made some improvements of making it brighter by 2.5 than the predecessor. This enables the users to 
    see the display in various lighting conditions. Apple has also announced a range of new bands with many colors and styles to choose from, such as the Solo loop and a 
    Braided Solo Loop. Neither has a clasp, which means you need to stretch the band over your wrist to put it on. One of the features that Apple was excited to talk about 
    would be the new fitness features. There's an additional health sensor on the belly of the watch that will monitor blood oxygen levels, and it does this through an app 
    called " Blood oxygen" and only takes 15 seconds to take a reading. It also collects data as you sleep or during the day as you go about your life. The gathered information 
    will be the basis for identifying any potential health issues you might have. All the other features remain the same, which you've probably become familiar with already 
    other than that. Thanks to the new S6 processor, the <i>series 6</i> is 20% faster than the series 5. It has raised the battery life to 18 hours to match the series 5 bus the 6 
    charges faster. You can get a full charge in 90 minutes.</p></li></ul>
