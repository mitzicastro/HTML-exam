  <p>The very first launched <i>apple watch</i> consists of three versions. The first is referred to as the "everyman edition", which is made of stainless steel. 
    Second, was the "sport version" which is made of aluminum and was made to appeal the more athletic audience. It also has a wristband equipped to working out 
    that is made out of nylon, has extra protection, and comes with several unique colors that you could chose from. The last version was made of no less than 18 
    karat gold. All three versions came in the sizes of both 38mm and 42mm. In addition, all of them had Bluetooth, wifi capabilities, and the ability to connect 
    with the iPhone. Although in order to do so, it would require internet access. It provides a digital crown, digital touch, force touch, multi-touch, and a side 
    button. It also has the ability to sense your heart rate in a manner of minutes. Since it was considered as a high-end fashion accessory, the price was a bit 
    expensive. It was in the market for about $17,000 which resulted in a low sale. As a matter of fact, it was never mentioned again.

 <h3>Series 1 and 2</h3>

<p>Since the overly expensive edition had been low on sales Apple had decided to drop the product but still kept the "sport version" that has been modified and 
  renamed, which is now known as <i>"Series 1"</i>. Apple had also decided to reduce their price a bit in order to make it affordable for most people. It still had the 
  aluminum build and the features remain like the original such as the side button, digital touch, force touch, multi-touch, and digital crown. In the same year, 
  Apple released "Series 2" into the market. The product still had the same aluminum build, but the main difference between both series was that unlike Series 1, 
  the Series 2 had a built-in GPS which gave the ability to pair the watch with an iPhone without the use of the internet. This has been very helpful since losing
  watches were a thing in the past. </p>

  <h3>Series 3 and 4</h3>

  </p>
  <p>After Series 1 and 2 were released, the following year <i>Series</i> 3 was launched. In this edition, the big difference was the addition of a cellular feature, allowing
    the watch to connect to mobile internet and get rid of the requirement for pairing with an iPhone. This definitely provided a brand new sense of connectivity. The 
    benefits include; being able to text messages, call, leave a voicemail, set reminders or alerts, use map features, and stream music.
    In 2018 <i>Series 4</i> was released. It featured some major improvements compared to Series 3 including larger displays and it had either 40mm or 44mm sizing rather than 
    38mm and 42mm. Another big improvement was the addition of an electrical heart sensor also known as "ECG/EKG". This allows the users to know their heart rate at any
    time. It has the ability to detect an unusual heart rate that will notify you, even if you do not feel any symptoms. This feature could potentially save lives.

  <h3>Series 5</h3>

  </p>
  <p>Apple watch <i>Series 5</i> has been considered as the best smartwatch in the world. They took all the good features from Series 3 and 4, then formed them into one sensational masterpiece.
     They added a couple more features but still made it with aluminum body. It offers the sizes 40mm and 44mm and gold, silver, and space grey colors. Depending on the size, which kind and color will determine how much the product 
     costs. There are more options with the <i>Series 5</i>, for an additional cost, you can get a stainless steel finish with the available colors of gold, space black, and silver. New to the <i>Series 5</i> is a titanium option, 
     which comes in space black. Lastly, there is a ceramic option that comes in pure white and also costs even more. The straps are changeable, and Apple made a collaboration with both Nike and Hermes for special edition sports and leather straps.
     The biggest design improvement is the introduction of the titanium option, which is lighter but more durable. It comes with a refined navigation performance thanks to a built in compass.  
  </br>  
  </br>
     The recently developed feature is the always-on-display, which is a response to previous user complaints of having to move one's wrist to wake up the display. Although in doing this, some argue that the always-on feature is a pain at night when you
     are trying to sleep because it is reactive meaning it gets brighter when it's needed, and dims when it isn't. Since Series 4 was alreadt a fast performer, any speed differences may be hard to spot. However, you still get everything you've come to know 
     with an Apple Watch - sleep tracking, breathing monitor, heart rate monitoring, GPS, and many more. The watch will usually last for about 18 hours a day and then in the evening you'll need to put it on charge. With the new software update it has added
     few more features. The health and fitness tracking has enhanced, women can now monitor and track menstrual cycles accurately and there are added activity tracking options. There are also new noise level alerts that tell you if your surroundings are too
     loud and may damage your hearing.
